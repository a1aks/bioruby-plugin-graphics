README.DEV)
</p>
<h2>Overview and terms used</h2>
<p>
This Bio::Graphics library allows for drawing overviews of genomic regions,
similar to the pictures drawn by <a
href="http://www.gmod.org/wiki/index.php/Gbrowse">gbrowse</a>. Basically,
it allows creating simple images that display features on a linear map,
including the position of subdomains in a protein (see picture). It&#8216;s
now also possible to create vertical pictures.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/protein_domains.png" />
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/vertical.png" />
</p>
<p>
Any Bio::Graphics image consists of the following parts (concepts and
nomenclature identical to that from <a
href="http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page">bioperl</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li>one panel: container of all tracks

</li>
<li>one or more tracks: container of the features. Multiple tracks can exist in
the same graphic to allow for differential visualization of different
feature types (e.g. genes as blue rectangles and polymorphisms as red
triangles)

</li>
<li>one or more features in each track: these are the actual features that you
want to display (e.g. &#8216;gene 1&#8217;, &#8216;SNP 123445&#8217;)

</li>
<li>a ruler on top of the panel: is added automatically

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Schematically:
</p>
<pre>
 panel
  +-&gt; track 1
  |     +-&gt; feature 1
  |     +-&gt; feature 2
  |     +-&gt; feature 3
  +-&gt; track 2
  |     +-&gt; feature 4
  |     +-&gt; feature 5
  +-&gt; ruler
</pre>
<p>
Below is an annotated version of the picture at the top of the page. The
whole picture makes up the panel, which contains one ruler and 3 tracks
(&#8216;scaffolds&#8217;, &#8216;markers&#8217; and &#8216;clones&#8217;).
Each of these tracks has zero or more features.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/terms.png" />
</p>
<p>
As a feature can only exist within the confines of a track and a track can
only exist within the confines of a panel, these classes are encapsulated.
This means that the Track class is not Bio::Graphics::Track, but
Bio::Graphics::Panel::Track; the same goes for
Bio::Graphics::Panel::Track::Feature.
</p>
<h2>Glyphs</h2>
<p>
According to Wikipedia, a <em>glyph</em> is &quot;the shape given in a
particular typeface to a specific grapheme or symbol&quot;. In the context
of Bio::Graphics, a glyph is just the thing that represents one single
feature. Several kinds of glyph exist to allow for features that are on a
particular strand as well as for spliced features. See the picture below
for an overview.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/glyph_showcase.png" />
</p>
<p>
If the view is really zoomed out, arrow on the directed glyphs are not
shown, as they would be bigger than the glyph itself.
</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>
The code below was used to create the picture showing all the different
glyphs mentioned above. This is not the nicest piece of code, but it is the
simplest. It is straightforward to parse a GFF file and create a picture
based on that. See my <a
href="http://saaientist.blogspot.com/2007/09/graphics-genomics-and-ruby.html">blog</a>
for an nicer example.
</p>
<p>
For an explanation of the arguments with each method for this example, see
the Bio::Graphics::Panel and Bio::Graphics::Panel::Track object
documentation.

<p>
Let&#8216;s walk through this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 2: load the actual library code. Make sure that the library is in your
RUBYLIB path.

</li>
<li>Line 5: Create the panel, which is nothing more than the canvas
you&#8216;ll be working on. The following parameters were used:

<ul>
<li>The sequence is 500 bp long.

</li>
<li>The width of the picture will be 1000 points.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lines 8-15: Create the different tracks. Parameters are:

<ul>
<li>name.

</li>
<li>flag if feature labels should be drawn (here: false)

</li>
<li>the default glyph for features in this track. This can be overridden on a
feature-by-feature basis. See the picture above and
Bio::Graphics::Panel::Track#new for allowed values.

</li>
<li>the default colour for features in this track. This can also be overridden
on a feature-by-feature basis. At the moment in RGB. (This will probably
change to colour names in the future).

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lines 18-47: Add features to each track. Parameters are:

<ul>
<li>a Bio::Feature object. (See bioruby documentation at <a
href="http://www.bioruby.org">www.bioruby.org</a>)

</li>
<li>the label to be used (here: all are &#8216;anonymous&#8217;)

</li>
<li>link.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Line 50: Create the actual picture. If the third parameter to the initial
Panel#new call (in line 5) is &#8216;true&#8217;, a HTML file is created as
well.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
That&#8216;s pretty clear, but what&#8216;s happening with the
composite_track (on lines 15 and 42-47)?
</p>
<p>
To set the glyph for a feature (or the default glyph in a track), you
normally use a symbol, like :generic or :directed_spliced. For composite
features, however, we&#8216;ve made it possible to have different
subfeatures drawn in different ways. In this example: we want to draw the
UTRs as thin lines, while the CDS is big boxes connected with thin lines.
How does this work? See lines 42 to 47. If the feature you&#8216;re adding
to a track has subfeatures, you can use the type of the subfeature to
direct the glyph to use. In the example above: the utr5 and utr3 have
&#8216;utr&#8217; as the first argument in the Bio::Feature#new, and the
cds object has &#8216;cds&#8217;. The transcript that gets created in line
46 takes these three Bio::Feature objects as subfeatures (the last
argument). Now up in line 15 we set the glyph of this track to the hash
{&#8216;utr&#8217; =&gt; :line, &#8216;cds&#8217; =&gt; :directed_spliced}.
What this does, is it takes each subfeature in turn, and draws it using the
glyph that matches its type.
</p>
<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>
There are no graphic formats that are inherently clickable (SVG is a
special case and the <em>display</em> of it is not the SVG itself).
Therefore, in case the user wants a clickable graphic, an accompanying HTML
file is created with the same name as the picture but obviously the .html
extension. This file contains the map and will display a clickable picture
when loaded in a webbrowser.
</p>
<h2>Download and installation</h2>
<p>
Development of the library is at <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/bio-graphics">rubyforge.org/projects/bio-graphics</a>/
</p>
<p>
There are different ways to install the library.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The easy way: gem install bio-graphics

</li>
<li>The hard (but cutting-edge) way: from SVN: svn checkout
svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/bio-graphics

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
You&#8216;ll need to have the following installed to use this library:
</p>
<ul>
<li>bioruby (<a href="http://www.bioruby.org">www.bioruby.org</a>), to parse
the feature locations.

</li>
<li>cairo (<a href="http://cairographics.org">cairographics.org</a>), to do the
actual drawing.

</li>
<li>pango (<a href="http://www.pango.org">www.pango.org</a>), to do the high
level text drawing.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<ul>
<li>gem install bio

</li>
<li>sudo apt-get install libcairo-ruby

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows (thanks to Naohisa Goto)</h3>
<p>
Install Ruby-GNOME2 Win32 GUI Installer, which contains rcairo-1.2.6. Get
it from ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/?News_20070212_1
(ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-1-i386-mswin32.exe)
</p>
<p>
During installation, check the &quot;Register enviroment variables&quot;
option.
</p>
<h3>Mac OSX (thanks to Ed Allen)</h3>
<p>
We haven&#8216;t figured out yet how to install cairo and pango separately
on a Mac. However, if you install Why The Lucky Stiff‘s Shoes GUI for
Ruby toolkit, you get the pango and ruby-pango bindings for free. Get it
from code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/DownloadShoes
